You have to evaluate the BST data structure in a concurrent context:

1. Make the BST thread-safe (Add needed mecanisms to guarantee data consistency). You can adapt (optimize) the structure while the BST properties are respected
2. Add monitor to evaluate the time of an insertion in the BST
3. Write a random generator to add randomly many objects in the BST
4. Write a benchmark where you can vary the number of thread
5. Writer a short report in which you present your results with nice graphics (e.g. random insertion time according to number of threads)
